                <h3>1. An introduction to classes in php (with js)</h3>
                <h3>2. Understanding PHP and MVC</h3>
                <h3>3. Front-End Demystified: A Deep Dive into Vue.js</h3>
                <h3>4. Full stack, with CI/CD and chatGPT</h3> <br><br>
            </div>
            The tutorial series contained on this platform has been the result of 2 years of research by it's
            creator,Philip Modinos. The main focus of the tutorials is a deep dive in concepts surrounding the practices
            of frameworks like laravel and vue.js. <br>
            The greatest problem that aspiring web developers face in their search for knowledge is the lack of context.
            This tutorial series aims to provide that context by providing a step by step guide to the creation of a
            full stack application. <br>
            The final part of the tutorial leverages all the knowledge accumulated from the previous parts to
            demonstrate how with the guidance of AI alongside the presets of laravel and vue.js, a developer can create
            a web application that's ready to go in a few hours, always demonstrating the process in it's full context.
